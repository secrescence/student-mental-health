# 🎓 Student Mental Health — Thesis Project

## 📘 Project Overview

**Student Mental Health** is a mobile application developed as a thesis project to support student well-being and enhance the services of the Guidance and Counseling Office.

The system integrates a **Priority Scheduling Algorithm** powered by the **DERS (Difficulty in Emotion Regulation Scale)** to assess student needs and automate appointment prioritization.

- 🔴 **High/Mid DERS Scores**: Automatically prioritized and scheduled with a counselor.
- 🟢 **Low DERS Scores**: Directed to self-help resources or can book appointments based on First-Come, First-Serve availability.

This ensures students get timely, needs-based support while optimizing counselor availability.
